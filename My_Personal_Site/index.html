        Hello my name is Porter and this is my website about me, Right now I am
        a lifeguard and am going to school to become a programmer! Right now I
        am attending fullstack and will be graduating in march and will go to
        look on for a job in this line of work. I am also an avid gym goer and
        go about 5 times a week. I had open heart surgery in December so im
        coming up on that one year mark and what year its been for me.
